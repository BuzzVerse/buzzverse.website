Thanks to technology that enables communication over long distances with low energy consumption, we can monitor parameters such as temperature or humidity in a given place. In the project, we use LoRa technology to observe the activity of bees in the beehive. The collected data is transferred to the mast and then to the database, where it is finally presented on our website. Our initiative not only provides valuable information for bee breeders, but also supports the protection of these insects important to the ecosystem.",
